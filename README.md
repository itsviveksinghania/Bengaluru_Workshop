# Bengaluru_Workshop
The workshop held in Bangalore offered comprehensive insights into multiple aspects of network security and data streaming technologies. A key aspect of the workshop was the exploration of mTLS, or Mutual Transport Layer Security, a protocol that ensures secure communication between client and server by using both server-side and client-side certificates.

The hands-on workshop also covered Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Access Control Lists (ACLs). Through this, participants learned how to create and manage permissions based on roles in a secure system. They also learned how to apply ACLs for granular authorization, controlling the permissions of individual users or groups on different resources.

A significant portion of the workshop was dedicated to Apache Kafka by Confluent, a real-time, distributed, and scalable data streaming platform. Here, participants got a chance to familiarize themselves with creating topics, producing, and consuming data, and handling secure communication.

Furthermore, the workshop delved into practical exercises involving the Linux Terminal and Vim. This enabled participants to navigate through a Linux system, manage files, and edit text via the terminal effectively. The use of Vim, a highly configurable text editor, was emphasized, highlighting its efficiency for various types of text manipulation and program development.

In summary, the workshop was a comprehensive course that combined theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience. It was successful in empowering the participants with the essential skills and understanding of mTLS, RBAC, ACLs, and Apache Kafka, alongside equipping them with the proficiency of Linux Terminal and Vim operations.
